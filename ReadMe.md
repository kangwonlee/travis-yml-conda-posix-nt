# A sample `.travis.yml` using `conda` on `linux`, `osx` and `windows`

## Description

* This file is intend to be a sample of `.travis.yml` file for the [Travis-CI](https://www.travis-ci.org).

### What is the CI ?

* CI here stands for [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)

* The Wikipedia describes as follows:
> ...**CI** is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

* To my understanding, when integrating a new work, the code base integrity must be confirmed.

* As CI may execute a number of tasks such as building, testing, and merging several times a day, certain level of automation is desirable.

* For example, [Jenkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)), an [open source](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins) project, can be employed to automate the CI/[CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery).
